So today we have with us April Winsell. Did I get that right? - Yes, it rhymes with pencil. (laughs) - Awesome. And I, you know, we've never met in person, which hopefully we get to do that somewhere along the way. But I've been following you on Twitter and seeing so much great stuff from you around the way that I'm looking at it, and I'm, we'll hear from you."

And I love that because I think as programmers, we sometimes struggle with, you know, bringing kindness to what we do in our energy. Our field also tends to attract neurodivergent folks. It's a better fit. And then they don't always get the kind of support and training that they need to learn to communicate well."

That's right. Yes. So I want to hear all about it, but first before we dive into that work, what's your background? Tell us about you. Sure. So I started programming in high school. So I was kind of like one of those typical stories."

Like it really felt like just being able to create these worlds, like these virtual worlds and everything, and just felt very empowering and fun."
